    <p id="aboutus">Starbucks is an American multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle’s Pike Place Market, it initially started as a coffee bean wholesaler1.Over the years, Starbucks has grown to become the world’s largest coffeehouse chain, with over 38,000 locations in 86 countries as of 20231. The company is known for its wide variety of coffee beverages, teas, pastries, and snacks, as well as its commitment to high-quality coffee and customer service12.
        Starbucks has also been a significant player in promoting the “second wave” of coffee culture, introducing a broader range of coffee experiences to the public1. The company emphasizes sustainability and ethical sourcing, aiming to have a positive impact on the communities it serves3.Starbucks is deeply committed to ethical sourcing through its Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices, developed with Conservation International. This program ensures economic transparency, social responsibility, and environmental leadership. Suppliers must provide evidence of payments to farmers, protect workers' rights, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Starbucks also employs third-party verification to maintain the integrity of these standards. Additionally, the company supports farmers through Farmer Support Centers, loans, and coffee tree donations. These efforts have enabled Starbucks to verify that 99% of its coffee is ethically sourced, positively impacting over a million farmers and workers globally.Starbucks is deeply committed to ethical sourcing through its Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.)
